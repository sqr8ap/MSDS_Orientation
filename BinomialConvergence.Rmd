```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

Show that the binomial and normal distributions converge at large N.

```{r}
# Small N
ggplot(data.frame(n=rbinom(50, size=100, prob=0.5)), aes(x=n))+geom_histogram()+theme_classic()
```

```{r}
# Large N
ggplot(data.frame(n=rbinom(5000, size=100, prob=0.5)), aes(x=n))+geom_histogram()+theme_classic()
```

As shown here, the larger N gets, the more normal the binomial distribution becomes. The CLT states that with a large enough sample size, the sampling distribution will be normal.
